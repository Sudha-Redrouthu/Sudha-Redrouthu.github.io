                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Infrastructure Automation</h3>
                    <p>I used Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to manage and set up servers for applications, making the whole process more streamlined and efficient. This allowed me to focus on improving the applications rather than dealing with server issues. By employing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) through Terraform, I defined and managed the infrastructure in a predictable way, keeping a clear record of different versions. My expertise also included setting up AKS for better reliability across servers, integrating it with Azure AD for security, and enforcing communication rules between parts of the application. With Terraform, I ensured that the server setups were consistent across development, testing, and production, which helped avoid any unexpected behavior. Additionally, I collaborated with others using version control systems like Git, which facilitated easy updates and reliable rollbacks of the AKS infrastructure when necessary.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Continuous Integration and Deployment</h3>
                    <p>In our team, we improved the way we build and release software by using a tool called Harness. We set up automated systems that made these processes quicker and more reliable, without needing too much complex coding. By treating our deployment processes as code, we made it easier for everyone to work together and keep track of changes. A big achievement was adding a feature from Harness that automatically checks if each release meets our quality standards, reducing the chances of errors. We also focused on security by setting specific access rules for different team members and safely managing sensitive information. We kept detailed records of all changes, which helped us stay organized and meet compliance requirements.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Containerization and Orchestration</h3>
                    <p>
                    In my work with containerization and orchestration, I utilized two pivotal tools, Docker and Kubernetes, to enhance the management of software projects. Docker was a key component in packaging my software, ensuring it operated seamlessly across various computing environments. This approach significantly streamlined my software development and deployment processes, making them more efficient and reliable. Additionally, I leveraged Kubernetes for managing these containerized applications. It allowed me to automate numerous tasks, including the deployment and scaling of software based on demand, and facilitated effective communication between different components of my software. This combination of Docker and Kubernetes was instrumental in optimizing my software management practices.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Scripting</h3>
                    <p>In my professional experience, I have extensively utilized scripting to enhance efficiency and automate repetitive tasks. My proficiency lies in writing and maintaining scripts in various languages like Python, Bash, and PowerShell, depending on the project requirements. These scripts have been instrumental in automating deployment processes, managing system configurations, and handling data manipulation tasks. My approach to scripting focuses on writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code, which has significantly reduced manual intervention and improved operational workflows. Additionally, my scripting skills have enabled me to quickly troubleshoot and resolve system issues, contributing to the overall reliability and performance of IT systems.</p>
